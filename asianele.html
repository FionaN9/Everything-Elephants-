        <p> Asian elephants, scientifically known as Elephas maximus, are remarkable creatures native to the forests and grasslands of South and Southeast Asia. They are found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, and Malaysia. They are highly social animals, often forming matriarchal herds led by an experienced female, while adult males tend to live solitary or in small bachelor groups. They communicate through vocalizations, infrasound (low-frequency sounds that travel long distances), and body language. Asian elephants are known for their high intelligence, complex emotions, and memory. They exhibit problem-solving skills, empathy, and even mourning behaviors. They love water and often bathe in rivers and streams, using their trunks to spray themselves.
        </p>
        <h1>Physical Features</h1>
        <p>Smaller than their African counterparts, Asian elephants are still massive. Adult males can weigh between 4,500 to 11,000 pounds (2,000 to 5,000 kg) and measure around 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3 m) at the shoulder.
            Their ears are smaller compared to African elephants and are shaped somewhat like the Indian subcontinent.
            They have thick, grayish-brown skin that is often marked with patches of pink pigmentation, especially on their trunks, ears, and foreheads.
            Unlike African elephants, not all Asian elephants have visible tusks. Males may have large tusks, but in some subspecies or populations, tusks are small or absent. Females generally lack tusks or have very small ones, called "tushes."
            Their trunk has one "finger-like" projection at the tip, whereas African elephants have two. The trunk is incredibly versatile, used for breathing, smelling, touching, feeding, drinking, and even communicating.
        </p>
        <h1>Diet </h1>
        <p>These herbivores are voracious eaters! Their diet includes grasses, fruits, bark, roots, and leaves. They can consume up to 330 pounds (150 kg) of food daily and need around 50 gallons (190 liters) of water.</p>
        <h1> Conservation Status </h1>
        The Asian elephant is listed as Endangered by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). Their population is declining due to habitat destruction, human-elephant conflict, and poaching for their ivory, skin, and other body parts.
