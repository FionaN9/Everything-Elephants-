  <li>Until 2021, African elephants were considered a single species, with forest elephants a subspecies. However, recent studies showed their DNA differed significantly, and in 2021, the two were recognised as distinct species.</li>
  <li>It is estimated that about 50,000 Asian elephants survive today.</li>
  <li>Approximately 13,000 of the 50,000 surviving Asian elephants are maintained in human care.</li>

  <li>Tusks can weigh over 200 pounds each.</li>
  <li>An elephant’s tooth can weigh as much as three kilograms.</li>
  <li>Elephants have a slow pulse of 27 pulses per minute.</li>
  <li>The elephant can’t jump; they are the only mammal that can’t.</li>
  <li>The elephant is the national animal of Thailand.</li>

  <li>An elephant’s trunk can hold 2.5 gallons of water.</li>
  <li>Elephant trunks are extremely sensitive – they contain no bones.</li>
  <li>The elephant trunk serves as a nose, a hand, an extra foot, a signaling device, and a tool for gathering food, siphoning water, dusting, digging, and much more.</li>
  <li>Elephants don’t drink with their trunks as if it were a straw, but instead use them as a glass holding the water and pouring it into their mouths.</li>
  <li>Elephants can swim and they use their trunk to breathe like a snorkel in deep water.</li>
  <li>Elephants can live up to 70 years.</li>
  <li>Sadly, in captivity, the lifespan of an elephant is much shorter, at a median age of only 17.</li>
  <li>By definition elephants don't run.</li>

  <li>An elephant’s skin is 2.5 cm thick in most places.</li>
  <li>They can get sub burnt. </li>
  <li>They can reach speeds of 40km/h.</li>
  <li>The folds and wrinkles in their skin can retain up to 10 times more water than flat skin, which helps cool them down.</li>
  <li>Elephants keep their skin clean and protect themselves from sunburn by taking regular dust and mud baths.</li>
  <li>The phrase “an elephant never forgets” comes from their fantastic long-term memory.</li>
  <li>Their ears are not just for hearing—they also help regulate body temperature. Flapping their massive ears cools the blood, which then circulates through their body to cool them down.</li>
  <li>Elephants have around 150,000 muscle units in their trunk, which serves as a nose, a hand, an extra foot, a signaling device, and a tool for gathering food, siphoning water, dusting, digging, and more.</li>
