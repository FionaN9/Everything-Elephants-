        <p> There are two species of African elephants: the African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis). The savannah elephant is larger and holds the title of the largest land animal.They are found across sub-Saharan Africa. The forest elephant is smaller and more elusive, it lives in dense, tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. Forest elephants play a vital ecological role by dispersing seeds and maintaining forest diversity. 
        </p>
        <h1> Savanna Physical Features</h1>
        <p> These giants can reach up to 10 to 13 feet (3 to 4 meters) at the shoulder and weigh between 5,000 to 14,000 pounds (2,300 to 6,350 kilograms).
            Both males and females have prominent, curved tusks made of ivory, which they use for digging, foraging, and defense. These tusks can grow up to 8 feet (2.5 meters) in length!
            Their large ears are shaped like the continent of Africa, and they help regulate body temperature by dissipating heat.
            They have gray, rough, and wrinkled skin about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, which helps minimize water loss and offers protection.
            
        </p>
        <h1> Forest Physical Features</h1>
        <p>African forest elephants are smaller compared to African savanna elephants, standing around 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) tall at the shoulder and weighing about 4,500 to 6,000 pounds (2,000 to 2,700 kg).
           Their tusks are straighter, thinner, and more downward-facing compared to their savanna cousins. These ivory tusks often have a pinkish tinge.
           They have rounded ears, though slightly smaller than those of the African savanna elephant.
           Their skin tends to be darker and more compactly wrinkled.
        </p>
        <h1>Diet </h1>
        <p>As herbivores, they consume grasses, leaves, fruits, bark, and shrubs. Adults can eat up to 300 pounds (136 kilograms) of food daily and require around 50 gallons (190 liters) of water. Savanna and forest elephants are “ecosystem engineers,” shaping their environment by uprooting trees, digging water holes, and dispersing seeds through their dung, helping forest regeneration.</p>
        <h1> Conservation Status </h1>
        <p>African savanna elephants are listed as Endangered due to habitat loss, poaching for ivory, and human-wildlife conflict. Forest elephants  as Critically Endangered due to the same challenges. The ivory trade has taken a toll on their populations, and despite international bans, poaching remains a threat.
